I'm going to ask you to take a look at this picture.
tell me everything that you see happening in that picture, everything
	that's going on there.
it's a family affair, a mother and the children.
and they're each busy at something.
and they seem oblivious to the water overflowing.
but they seem happy in doing their own thing.
I lost that.
I think I.
okay.
that was fine.
