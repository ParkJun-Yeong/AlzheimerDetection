what I'm gonna do now, is I'm gonna show you a picture.
and in the picture there's some action taking place.
there's some things going on, okay.
what I want you to do is look at the picture and tell me anything you see
	that's going on.
okay Junior's in the cookie jar.
and he's just about to go have himself an accident.
his sister's standing down below waiting for a handful of cookies.
and his mom's drying the dishes I think.
and she's having problems because the sink's running over and she's
	standing in a puddle of water, some empty dishes on the counter.
as far as the action that's just about it.
okay.
