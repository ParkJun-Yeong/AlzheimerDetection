just take a look at this picture and tell me everything that you see
	happening in that picture.
alright a little boy has a cookie jar.
okay he's got on the ladder and trying to get a jar.
and this is the mother I guess.
right.
mhm.
she is so.
she really isn't any good sense of a mother because the water's running
	out_of the sink to the floor.
so if I was a mother I would spank her.
right.
