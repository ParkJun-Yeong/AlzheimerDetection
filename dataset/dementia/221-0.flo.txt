here's the picture.
you just want me to start talking.
all of the action.
well the little girl is asking her brother we'll say for a cookie.
now he's getting the cookie one for him and one for her.
he unbalances the little stool and he's about to fall.
and the lid's off the cookie jar.
and the mother is drying the dishes abstractly so she's left the water
	running in the sink and it is spilling onto the floor.
and there's look like two cups and a plate on the sink and board.
and that boy's wearing shorts and the little girl is in a short skirt.
and the mother has an apron on.
and she's standing at the window.
the window's opened.
it must be summer or spring.
and the curtains are pulled back.
and they have a nice walk around their house.
and there's this nice shrubbery it appears and grass.
and there's a big picture window in the background that has the drapes
	pulled off.
not pulled off but pulled aside.
and there's a tree in the background.
and the kitchen has a_lot_of cupboard space under the sink board and under
	the cabinet from which the you_know cookies are being removed.
and is that enough.
that's fine.
okay good.
