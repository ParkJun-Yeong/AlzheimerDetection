wahoo ho ho.
well it's kind_of a calamity isn't it.
the mother just is.
I assume this is the mother.
and trying to wash the dishes and the water's overflowing.
and the little boy's trying to get cookies out_of the cookie jar on top of
	the cupboard.
and his stool is getting away under him.
and she keeps holding her hand up waiting for another cookie.
mhm.
okay that's good.
