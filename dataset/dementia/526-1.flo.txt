tell me what's going on in that picture.
there's a little girl talking to this boy up on the stool.
and she's asking him to bring some of this down or whatever it was a jar or
	whatever it is so it doesn't break.
there's a mother over here.
she's watching them that she has that break in her hand.
and it looks like it's very strong or x or.
she's looking real good at it, a jar or whatever.
what else is going on over here.
she's giving a little touch of her mouth.
that's right.
although that's.
anything else.
and it looks like he's gonna bring some of that down for them all.
and mother's out there looking at them.
and looks like she's washing this dishes that they already had it.
and she's washing the dishes away from them.
okay.
it looks that way.
good.
she's cleaning it you_know.
good.
