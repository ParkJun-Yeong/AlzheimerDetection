I want you to tell me everything that you see going on in this picture.
everything that you see happening there.
yeah, alright.
the girl is reaching up for a cookie.
the youngster's getting the cookie out_of the cupboard.
the cookie is in the jar jar.
the stool that he's standing on is falling.
the door to the cookie cupboard is open.
the lady is washing dishes.
she has a dish cloth in her hand.
the sink is running over.
the spigot is not shut off.
there's two handles and neither one is shut off.
and it's falling on the floor.
there's two cups and a dish on the counter+tops.
there's curtains.
there's two windows.
at least there's a window with two panes showing, partial the others.
and it looks like a scenery outside like a walk and some bushes and things.
and some bushes in front of some kind of a building.
she has on an apron, shoes.
and the young girl has shoes and stockings on and the boy has stockings on
	and shoes.
and the cabinet has two three four five doors to it.
