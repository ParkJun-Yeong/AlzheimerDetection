what I'd like you to do is just to tell me everything that you see going on
	in the picture.
okay.
everything you see going on in the picture.
well Johnny's in the cookie jar handing cookies to his sister who has her
	fingers up to her lips.
he's at the cupboard above the counter+top.
the mother has her back to them drying dishes.
the water's overflowing from the sink.
the window's up.
and she has on a dress with an apron.
and cups are on the counter+top and the water is on the floor.
oh and he's about to fall because the step+stool is tilting because he's up
	there getting into the cookie jar.
that's all that's there that I can see.
