going on in that picture.
what's happening there.
oh my.
poor kids.
he's gonna fall off that cookie jar.
we'll start with the girl.
she's going to receive a cookie.
her brother is taking cookies out_of a jar.
and he got careless.
and she's asking him for one.
so he's handing one down to her.
in the meantime he is getting ready to fall off of a stool, a three legged
	stool.
and the mother's not paying much attention.
she's looking out the window.
and in looking out the window why she's letting her sink run over and the
	water's splashing on the floor all over her.
and what else.
the outside looks alright.
they're doing more things on the outside.
there's some more there.
and then she's drying a dish.
and she has two cups and a plate on the table.
they've already eaten.
well I did say she was letting the water run over the sink down onto the
	floor splashing onto her feet.
oh boy.
then there's an angle here that is incomplete of the corner where the wall
	comes together.
let's see what else should there be.
oh let's see.
there's a plate two cups.
oh I did say she's letting the water run over the sink didn't I.
yes.
mhm.
and she seems to be looking out the window while she's drying her dish.
how_about that.
