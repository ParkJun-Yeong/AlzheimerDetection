I'd like for you to take a look at this picture.
take a look at that picture and tell me everything you see going on there.
hm.
everything that's happening.
the little boy is on the stool which is tipping and he wants cookies to
	give to his sister.
he has a handful of cookies in one hand already and the little girl is
	eating a cookie.
the mother is washing dishes absentmindedly.
she let the sink run over and it's all on the floor.
there's a window you can see their driveway.
either bushes or trees and grass a big window.
and a tree coming up here.
and part of the roof.
okay.
and the cookie says cookie jar.
okay thanks.
