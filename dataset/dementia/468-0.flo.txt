oh anything I see.
right.
well there's a little girl here.
she's pointing at something.
and that looks like her brother is just about ready to fall down where
	she's sitting there where it says cookie jar.
and here on her right side there's a young lady there.
she's washing what she.
she's cleaning.
okay.

she's cleaning.
what is she.
she.
