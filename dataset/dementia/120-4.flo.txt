tell me everything you see happening there, everything that's going on in
	that picture.
okay well the little boy is taking some cookies when his mother's not
	looking and is going to fall off the stool because it's tipping over.
and the little girl is saying sh as she reaches up for a cookie.
and pretty soon it's not gonna be very quiet.
the mother is wiping the dishes as the sink is overflowing on the floor and
	she's walking in the water and apparently unconcerned.
and the window is open.
now as far as things happening I guess that's about it.
okay, good.
she's wiping the dishes.
mhm.
