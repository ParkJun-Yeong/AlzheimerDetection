so we can hear you because I usually can't get it all written down.
okay uhhuh.
so if you tell me what you see.
well the boy's up on the stool.
oh the stool gonna fall with the cookie jar and the lid toppled over.
and what about the young lady.
the little lady, she's helping him get the cookies I guess.
the momma she's doing the dishes and what did she let the spigot run over
	for on the floor all over the place.
and there's dishes there, plates and cups and saucers.
and what else.
just what's there honey.
it's a nice yard out there and curtains in the window it looks like.
three pieces of to eat on.
pardon me.
I said three pieces of to eat on food platter and cups, saucer.
I guess that's for the under sink to put things.
not much interest in the housekeeping.
it's about all.
that's the curtains.
see anything else.
the ones are nice, sunny.
there's one spill the water in there.
wonder if he got a cookie.
is that it.
uhhuh.
