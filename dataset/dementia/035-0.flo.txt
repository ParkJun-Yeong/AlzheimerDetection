that's the picture.
oh.
oh great.
oh the boy is taking cookies.
and he's also going to fall off his step+stool.
I gather it's his sister is reaching for the cookies.
the mother is drying the dishes and obviously has her mind on something
	else because the water's coming down out_of the sink onto the floor.
and she is also standing in water.
I don't know.
that's it.
I didn't hear what he said then because it's.
that is all that I can see here.
okay.
thank you.
