little girl is reaching up for some cookies.
and it appears that she may be telling her brother to be quiet.
they may be taking them while the mother is distracted there at the window.
yeah she is distracted.
she doesn't even know the sink is overflowing.
the boy getting the cookies from the cookie jar in his haste has tipped
	over the lid of the cookie jar and also has caused the stool to slip over
	backwards so that he will very shortly be on the floor rather.
and the mother's still day dreaming and the sink's still overflowing and
	she's looking out at the garden and a tree.
and she has a towel in her hand.
and she's probably dried a few dishes.
well that's about it for me.
okay good.
