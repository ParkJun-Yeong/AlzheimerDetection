here's the picture.
all of the action.
okay I'll start.
the mother is drying dishes.
and the sink is over flowing.
the water is falling onto the floor.
the boy is on his stool taking cookies out_of a cookie jar.
and he has two cookies one in each hand.
the girl is standing, reaching up for a cookie with her finger over her
	mouth telling him to be quiet.
the stool is on one leg.
there's drapes on the window.
there's a path between the grass and the bushes.
and this little picture is a part of the house and part of the tree in the
	upper window.
there are doors on the cabinets in the sink.
and it's daylight.
there's two cups and a dish on the sink.
should I describe the two faucets.
that's okay.
that's fine.
okay.
