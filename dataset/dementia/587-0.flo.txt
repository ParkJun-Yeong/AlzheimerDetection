I want you to tell me everything you see happening in that picture.
everything.
everything you see happening.
happening.
yeah everything that's going on.
mhm.
what's happening in that picture.
well this is the boy trying to get the cookie jar down for his sister I
	would imagine it is.
and he's gonna fall off his stool or whatever he is setting on.
the mother is over here.
she just spilled some water or whatever on the floor.
and she looks pretty mad.
mhm.
and the water's still running.
and it looks like the girl is laughing at the boy because the stool is
	gonna fall over.
and there's water on the floor there.
