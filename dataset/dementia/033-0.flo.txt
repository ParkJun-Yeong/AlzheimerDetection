and there it is.
okay.
apparently a mother and a daughter and a son are in the kitchen.
and the son is standing on the stool which is tilting.
and he has his hand in the cookie jar and handing one cookie to his sister.
at the same time the mother is doing dishes and apparently looking out the
	window because she has allowed the sink to run over and it's cascading onto
	the floor and her feet.
she has dried a few dishes two cups and a plate and is attempting to dry
	another plate now.
and she's looking out into the yard which I could see the driveway and
	maybe the end of the house or the garage with a_lot_of shrubbery around it.
okay good.
