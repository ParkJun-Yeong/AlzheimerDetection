okay all of the action.
okay.
we see a little boy climbed up on a stool reaching for the cookie jar.
and the stool is falling.
he is trying to get a cookie for himself and also one for his sister.
his sister is telling him to be very quiet.
she's going shh.
can't write that down.
telling him to be quiet.
and let's see.
in the meantime the mother is washing dishes and the sink has overflowed
	and is pouring water on the floor.
I don't think I see anything else.
well good, that's about all there is to see.
okay.
