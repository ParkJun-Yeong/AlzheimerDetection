I want you to take a look at that picture and tell me everything that you
	see going on in that picture.
everything that's happening there.
well little boy throat reaching out for the cookie jar.
and the stool he's standing on tilts over.
and he's handing some cookies down to the little girl.
and the mother's drying dishes and spills water on the floor.
and she's looking out the window.
that's it.
good.
