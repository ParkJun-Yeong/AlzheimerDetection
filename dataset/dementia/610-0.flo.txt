I'd like for you to look at this picture and tell me what you see going on
	there.
what's happening in that picture.
they're baking.
what else is going on.
making a mess out_of the place.
how.
by no neatness.
do you see anything else happening there.
yes there's a few accidents.
the little boy is standing on a stool which is crooked.
the lady has water running out_of her sink and towel in her hand which is
	dangerous.
the cookie jar is coming down.
and the place is very pretty.
okay good.
