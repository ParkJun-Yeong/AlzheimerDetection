I see a boy getting into the cookie jar.
and he's very precarious.
the stool he's standing on is tipping him over.
and the little girl wants a cookie.
and mama doesn't notice what's going on.
she's too busy washing dishes.
and she's too busy to see that the sink is overflowing.
oh is.
you mean the action.
you just want action.
mhm.
she's stepping in the water.
the little girl is begging for a cookie.
maybe I told you that though.
shall I tell you more.
okay that's fine.
just.
no that's fine.
the cookies cups and saucers and so.
