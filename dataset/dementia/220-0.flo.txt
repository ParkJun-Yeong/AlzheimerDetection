okay.
in the picture.
cookie jar.
okay.
and two children.
the boy's up on a stool and the little girl's standing up holding her hand
	for a cookie.
then there's a lady that is drying some dishes.
but the only thing she is she getting water on the floor.
she has a problem there.
and she has two plates and two.
and the water comes sprinkling over.
and the boy's up at the cookie jar.
and his sister didn't get a cookie from him yet.
but he has one in his hand now.
he has one in his hand and one in the top of the cookie jar.
so she finally got a cookie.
if he ever puts his arm down.
hers is up but he's still got his right in his hand.
