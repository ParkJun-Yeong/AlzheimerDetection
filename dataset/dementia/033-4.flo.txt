let's just take a look at that picture.
and tell me everything that you see happening in that picture.
everything that's going on there.
okay.
there are three persons in the kitchen.
the little girl is instructing the little boy to take cookies out_of the
	cookie jar on the second shelf of the cupboard.
and at the same time his stool that he's standing on is about to collapse.
the mother apparently is doing dishes and looking out the window.
has the faucet on in the sink.
and apparently the plug is in and the water is cascading over the kitchen
	floor.
and it must be a warm sunny day because the window is open.
and I can see the shrubbery and what appears to be the end of the house
	maybe a garage door.
and on the counter there are dishes that the mother has either washed or
	has dried and is still washing a plate.
okay.
thanks.
