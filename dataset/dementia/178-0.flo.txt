just tell me all of the action that you see going on in the picture.
the boy is to get in the cookie jar.
and he's falling over.
and the girl is holding up her hand.
and the sink is running over.
and the mother is drying dishes.
and.
can you think of anything else that's going on.
is there any more action.
no.
okay that's fine.
