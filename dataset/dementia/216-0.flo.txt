there it is.
well there's a kid in a cookie jar.
there's a girl waiting for some food.
the mother spilled the water.
and she's drying a dish.
and a kid standing on a stool that's tilted.
he's in the cookie jar.
and the water is coming over the sink.
and the window is open.
and that's about all I can tell.
okay.
