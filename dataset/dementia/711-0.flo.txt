I want you to take a look at this picture here and tell me everything that
	you see happening in that picture.
oh you want me to tell you.
yeah just tell me everything that you see going on in that picture.
the mother and her two children.
and the children are getting in the cookie jar.
and she's doing the dishes and spilling the water.
and she had the spigot on and she didn't know it perhaps.
pardon me.
and they're looking out into the garden from the kitchen window.
it's open.
and the cookies must be pretty good they're eating.
the stool is tilting and he's gonna fall off.
and the mother's splashing her shoes and stockings all up overflowing the
	water.
and there's a window and curtains on the window.
and I can see some trees outside there.
and there's dishes that had been washed and she's drying them.
and there's some shrub out there and.
okay very good.
