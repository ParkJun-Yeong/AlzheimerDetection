I want you to take a look at this picture.
I want you to tell me everything that you see happening in that picture.
everything that you see going on there.
the sink is running over.
and the lady's drying the dishes.
and the boy's crawled up on the stool and it's falling and he's gonna fall
	down.
and he's handing the cookie to the little girl.
and let's see.
the cupboard door is open and he was in the cookie jar after the cookies.
and I don't know.
okay that's fine thank you.
