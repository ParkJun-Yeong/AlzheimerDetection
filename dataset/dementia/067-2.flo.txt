and he's up trying to get something out_of the garden selection I think it
	is.
the little girl I think is mad because she didn't get some of it.
and here's mama drying the dishes.
okay.
anything else going on.
no just the little girl and the boy was on here.

the little girl and the boy.
anything else.
she's reaching up to the boy and the boy got his other hand down.
mhm.

anything else.

no that's all.
what's going on over here.
anything else.

from the sink down.
it came splashing down.
