a picture.
okay.
well the little boy was looking at that cookie jar and he started to tip
	over.
she was talking with him and wanting him to give her some cookies I guess.
and it's turning it over.
I don't know whether he got hurt or not.
probably did.
because his mom is right behind him and maybe she could have caught him.
and the mother is washing the dishes but she let the water go so fast and
	so full that it's all the way down.
and she'll hafta clean it all up.
she'll hafta get the little kids out so she can.
okay.
yeah.
okay good.
