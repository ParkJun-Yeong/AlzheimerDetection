you see going on in that picture.
alright.
mama's washing the dishes.
the water is running over in the sink.
and the children are in the cookie jar and one of them is going to get hurt
	because he's got the stool.
he has nothing to hold onto there.
he does have but he's not doing it.
the little girl has him interested in the cookie jar.
anything else going on over here.
what's he got on his feet.
that's the only thing I can see there.
okay.
over here poor mama.
okay.
she's dreaming of diamonds I guess.
okay.
all the water running out_of the sink.
okay.
