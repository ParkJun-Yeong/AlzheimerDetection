what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna show you a picture.
and in the picture there are some things going on.
there's some action taking place.
what I want you to do is look at the picture and just tell me anything you
	see happening any action.
well your sink is being run over, the water.
the stool the kid's standing on is falling.
and he's getting cookies from a jar.
the lady's washing dishes.
the girl's reaching for a cookie.
could there be more.
okay, anything else.
I don't think so.
okay.
