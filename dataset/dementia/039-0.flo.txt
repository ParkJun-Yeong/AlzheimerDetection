okay you can begin.
okay we see first of all the sink is overflowing.
water cascading down the kitchen cabinet onto the floor.
the lady in the picture is drying a dish.
there is a young man on a stool.
and the stool is being tipped over.
he's reaching for a cookie jar.
the lid is off the jar and it looks like he's going to try to hand a cookie
	down to his little sister.
and looks like he might make it before he hits the floor.
anything else.
I don't think so.
okay good.
