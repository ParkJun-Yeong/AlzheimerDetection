on in the picture.
well the girl is telling the boy to get the cookies down but don't tell
	your mother.
and the boy is also falling over off the stool.
and the mother is letting the water run out_of the sink.
and she's drying dishes.
I don't quite get that but then.
she has water on the floor and basically it's kind_of a distressing scene.
everything's going haywire.
okay.
she needs to turn off the water.
if she turned off the water she'd be a hundred percent better off.
okay.
okay.
