okay and here's the picture.
tell me all the action.
oh little boy's in the cookie jar.
the girl's standing down and waiting for him to give her some.
the mother's doing the dishes.
and she's also letting.
oh the water just fell over on the floor.
can I turn the page.
that's all there is.
okay.
that's all there is except she's just getting all wet.
is that everything in the picture.
no.
the little girl was helping the boy to get to the cookie jar.
but he started stumbling.
he must have fell over because he seems to be falling there.
and the mother's over at the sink drying dishes.
and it's going on the floor.
and three three bowls there.
okay that's fine.
