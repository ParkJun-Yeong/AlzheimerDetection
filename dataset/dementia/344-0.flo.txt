going on in the picture.
well the boy's getting in the cookie jar.
and he's standing on a stool that is falling over.
and his sister maybe is telling him to be quiet so his mother won't see
	him.
in the meantime the sink is running over on to the floor and she's drying
	dishes.
and there's something going on outside the window.
I don't know just what it is.
she's drying dishes but I don't get the connection between the picture
	outside.
I guess she's having her problems and they're having theirs.
okay.
okay good.
