I'd like for you to take a look at that picture.
I want you to tell me everything that you see happening in that picture,
	everything that's going on there.
oh that kid's gonna get a good spill off of that stool if his mother don't
	turn around there and catch him.
gonna drop whatever he's got in his hands.
anything else you see going on.
what else is happening in that picture.
the little girl's reaching up there to get something from the boy.
I think he's gonna land himself on the floor the way he does it.
mkay.
