well that boy's trying to get some cookies.
and the girl's holding her hand up because he has gotten one and she wants
	it.
and where he's climbing up is falling over.
and this girl she's washing dishes.
and she has something there for the dinner.
and she spilled the water.
and it's all on the floor going.
she has a dish cloth in her hand.
and the boy he's trying to get the cookies out of the jar for her.
but he's gonna fall over by the way it looks.
okay.
and she's spilled some water and stepping in it.
okay.
