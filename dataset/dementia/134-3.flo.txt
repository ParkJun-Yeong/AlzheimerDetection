this is the last thing we hafta do today.
I'd like for you to take a look at this picture.
mhm.
and tell me everything that you see going on in that picture, everything
	that's happening there.
oh.
well there's a boy on the.
I forget what you call that.
on a stool I guess climbed up to get some cookies out of the cupboard.
and his sister was standing there waiting for one.
and then over here the lady was washing the dishes in the sink with the
	water in it spilled all on the floor.
okay.
mhm.
that's it.
good.
