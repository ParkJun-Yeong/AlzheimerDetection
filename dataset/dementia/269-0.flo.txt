action you see going on in that picture.
well I'm seeing a_lot_of water that isn't sposta be where it is.
a full sink with more water running down all the way to the floor.
a stool that's going to project somebody into a fall and real fast.
getting out_of the cookie jar.
dishwashing and drying.
and a girl trying to say silent so that they won't be caught.
two cups and a plate that probably are dry and then the other plate is
	being dried.
a cupboard door that's open.
that stool though, I don't know what he's going to do with that.
I don't know why the water's left on.
it's gonna make a mess.
she's drying the plate or the dishes or whatever it is that she's working
	on.
and of_course that cupboard door is open.
if it hadn't been opened why maybe he wouldn't have gotten his cookies.
anything else.
well otherwise it's except for the two accidents it's not too bad.
but the boy hasn't gotten down to his fall yet.
is that it.
that's the way with boys you_know.
