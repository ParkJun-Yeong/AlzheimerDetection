picture.
well the boy is taking cookies out of the cookie jar.
and he's handing one to his sister as he almost falls off his stool.
and he has knocked the lid off the cookie jar.
and the mother is washing dishes.
and she has let the sink overflow and she's standing in a puddle.
and window is open.
and there's a view of the back of the house with a hedge and a nice walk
	and a grassy area.
and the curtains are blowing in the wind.
and she's standing in a puddle.
and so that's about all.
okay that's fine.
