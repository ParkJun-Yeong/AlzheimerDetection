what do you see going on in that picture.
oh yeah.
kid's climbing up on the stool and reaching up in the cupboard.
they aren't gonna knock things off.
and oh boy the water's all spilling out of the sink.
she's just looking at it like.
oh for goodness sakes.
huh.
anything else.
well as I say that you_know the boy on that stool and it's tilting.
that's a good way to break his neck.
break his back I shoulda said.
woman left her faucet running and it rolled over the floor.
that's bad enough for me to do.
is that it.
let me scan it a little bit more.
oh it's there more in time.
no that's all.
oh.
no it's that one.
is that it.
yeah.
okay.
