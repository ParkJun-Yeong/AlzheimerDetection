there's the picture.
well the little boy's handing his sister a cookie.
and he's swiping one for himself.
and he's got the standing on the stool on the two legs.
and the mother's running the sink over.
and she's drying a plate.
is there a number that there's sposta be on it.
just tell me everything that you see happening there.
well she's standing in water.
she could get her foot wet.
is that everything.
probably is.
well the spigot's on so that's.
mhm.
the water.
she's standing in the water.
and the stool.
he's standing on the stool.
and cookies.
that path looks as though it's coming in the window but that wouldn't have
	anything probably to do with the picture so.
hm.
okay.
and two cups.
I guess that's about all I can see.
okay.
