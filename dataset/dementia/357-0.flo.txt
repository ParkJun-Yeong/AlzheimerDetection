in the picture.
I see two kids up at the cookie jar, one on a stool the other standing on
	the floor.
cupboard door is opened.
mother's washing the dishes.
the water is overflowing the sink.
and there's two cups and a plate on the counter.
and she's holding a plate in her hand.
curtains at the windows.
the cookie jar has the lid off.
that's about it.
cupboards underneath the sink.
cupboards underneath the other cupboards.
kid falling off the stool.
the girl laughing at him.
cookies in the cookie jar with the lid off.
he has a cookie in his hand.
and that's it.
okay good.
