alright.
now I would like for you to take a look at this picture.
take a look at that picture and tell me what you see going on in there.
tell me everything that's happening in that picture.
the boy is reaching for a cookie jar but the stool is falling.
he was getting a cookie for his sister and for himself.
oh_my_gosh look at the sink is overflowing.
and at the time she's drying a dish.
I don't know why she didn't turn the water off.
now what did you tell me.
just what's happening that's all.
