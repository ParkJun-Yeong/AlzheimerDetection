there's the picture.
you can start whenever you want.
it's a picture of a kitchen.
there's a child reaching in a cookie jar.
a boy reaching into a cookie jar.
he's falling.
the stool is falling.
a female youngster maybe sister is reaching up and she's got a finger to
	her lip.
the mother is at the sink washing a dish.
the water is spilling over from the sink.
the window is open looking out onto shrubbery and a path to another house.
there are three dishes sitting on the sink counter.
and there are a number of cabinets in the picture on the sink counter as it
	stretches around.
and there's the cabinets above where the boy is reaching in.
mother is washing a dish.
she is dressed in a oh dress and it appears she has an apron and a towel in
	her hand.
as she's washing one of her feet is obviously in the water the other is
	somewhat obliterated.
the children are completely outfitted.
the girl with sandals of some kind and the boy it looks like maybe tennis
	shoes.
good.
good.
thank you.
