tell me all the action you see going on in the picture.
oh my.
you mean how much or just the ones.
just tell me all the action.
tell me what's going on.
oh.
the sink is overflowing while she's wiping a plate and not looking.
mhm.
the little boy is hungry.
he wants to get some cookies.
and he's standing on a stool.
and it's tipping over.
and I don't know whether he's gonna bring the cookie jar with him or what.
and the little girl is holding up her hand wanting some.
and he's gonna give to her.
but I don't know if she has a finger to her mouth but.
and she knows that he's gonna be tipping over it looks like to me.
uhhuh.
or maybe she's just not noticing it and making her mouth get ready for this
	good cookie.
I don't know which way it is for the little girl.
because she's smiling.
I think if she saw him falling over she'd do something to help him so he
	wouldn't get hurt.
I_mean she'd grab it or something.
mhm.
but she's just looking up at him you_know looking up at those good cookies
	and waiting for them to come to her hand.
but this little finger in her mouth is.
I'm not quite sure what it means.
I think it means that it's gonna be good.
mhm probably.
yeah.
okay.
and I don't know whether the mother knows this is wet yet.
she's gonna find out isn't she.
she's thinking something else I think.
I don't know what it is.
what are we going to have for lunch.
or she's got something in her mind because certainly she'd see this if she
	didn't hear it.
okay.
