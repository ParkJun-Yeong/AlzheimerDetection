and okay.
and here's the picture.
oh boy.
alright.
family is in the kitchen.
the mother's washing dishes.
and her sink is overflowing.
and she's looking out the window.
and they're stealing cookies out_of the cupboard.
and the boy looks like he's gonna fall down and hurt himself or fall
	against his mother.
and the girl is whispering don't make too much noise to him.
or else she's laughing at him.
they got the cookies.
alright now though the window, let's see.
there's a nice look outside, real nice.
I told you the water was running over and splashing onto the floor.
mhm.
and the mother doesn't seem too too affected by it.
she's drying a dish or wiping it.
let's see.
I guess the girl is laughing at her brother because he's going to fall.
okay.
looks like a nice house.
there is very little but I don't think that's meant for this.
okay.
the corner that got to the corner.
so this is a corner here.
uhhuh.
and that goes back into there but that's.
okay good.
do you see what I'm making reference to.
yeah yeah.
