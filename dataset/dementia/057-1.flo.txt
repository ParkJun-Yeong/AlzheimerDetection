mhm.
the little girl's going sh.
and she's also reaching up to get a cookie.
and the little boy is reaching for a cookie.
and the stool is tilting.
and he's holding a cookie in his left hand.
and the mother's drying dishes.
and the dish water is on and it's pouring over onto the floor.
and the curtains are blowing.
the window's up.
let me see.
she's drying the dishes.
I don't know whether I said that or not.
I can't see any other.
the leaves are blowing on the trees.
okay that's good.
