okay here's the picture.
just tell me all of the action.
and I will tell you what's.
what's going on in the picture.
oh boy.
well the little boy is reaching for a cookie.
and his stool is falling over.
mhm.
and the little girl is begging him to give her one.
and she's pointing to her mouth.
she wants to eat it.
their mama is doing the dishes.
the water's running over the sink.
that's a mess.
hm.
and then she's not even looking at them.
drying dishes.
I think she's looking out the window.
it's a nice yard out there.
two cups and a dish finished.
anything else.
no that looks pretty good.
okay.
okay good.
