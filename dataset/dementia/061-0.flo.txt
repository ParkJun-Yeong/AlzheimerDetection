okay there you go.
there's the picture.
is it alright to say mother and son and daughter.
mhm.
mother is wiping dishes but she's overflowing the sink bowl.
water is running on the floor.
outside I can't tell if it's a cloudy day or a great day but you can see
	some shrubbery and bushes.
and the tilting stool is about to fall.
taking cookies for he and his sister out_of the cookie jar.
so somebody's gonna have some cleanup work to do.
and the daughter of course reaching her left arm and hand and elbow up to
	receive a cookie.
but he's gonna go crashing on down the floor where the water is going, the
	suds water.
I do the dishes sometimes at home.
but with the dishwasher it's just pots and pans.
mhm.
fry pans, do our eggs in the morning.
mhm.
I use rubber gloves because skin cracks around my nails.
mhm.
and I put bandaids and petroleum jelly Vaseline on them.
that's good.
good.
mhm.
okay anything else you wanna say about the picture.
the drapes are alright.
I don't see anything else.
okay.
