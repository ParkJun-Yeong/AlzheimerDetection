the girl's washing dishes.
the water's spilling over onto the floor.
the boy is taking some cookies and his stool is falling out from under him.
the girl's stepping in the water.
she's wiping dishes.
there's a view of a house through the door on the outside.
the window is half opened.
the curtains are tied back.
the cookie jar is in the cupboard on the second shelf.
okay that's good.
