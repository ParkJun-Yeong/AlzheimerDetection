kid trying to get into the cookie jar.
and he missed the thing.
and he still isn't going out for them.
and his sister whoever it is has caught him at it.
and he's gonna hafta do the dishes because his mother can't let him go
	scotfree.
and of_course the water's pouring out_of the sink onto the floor already.
she didn't even take the plug out.
okay anything else.
well there's other colors here.
and, it isn't the first time this boy has done this.
he been doing it all his life but his mother didn't find out until he was
	big enough to walk.
okay.
