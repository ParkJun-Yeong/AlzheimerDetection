tell me all the action.
mhm.
okay.
there's a young boy going in a cookie jar.
and there's a young girl.
and I'm saying he's a boy because it's hard to tell anymore.
and he's in the cookie jar.
and there's a stool that he is on and it already is starting to fall over.
and so is the water in the sink is overflowing in the sink.
okay anything else.
I don't know about this hickey here whether that's more than what I said.
like the mother is near the girl.
and she has.
