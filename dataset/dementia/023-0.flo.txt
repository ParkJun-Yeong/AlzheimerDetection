everything that's happening in that picture.
well I see the mother.
what's she doing.
pouring the faucet down on the floor.
yeah she got that running on the floor.
she's wiping the dishes.
and the little boy's gonna break his neck trying to get into the cookie
	jar.
and the little girl's yelling for more.
they're heading into a disaster.
okay.
anything else.
well the little boy's gonna break his neck there if he doesn't watch out.
now I expect there are a whole lot more that I didn't see.
okay that's fine.
