I want you to take a look at this picture here.
I want you to tell me everything that's going on in that picture.
everything that you see happening in that picture.
well the boy is reaching for some cookies.
and they're in a jar in a cupboard.
and the stool is breaking down.
and the girl is waiting to be handed one of the cookies.
he's in the cupboard trying to get a cookies out_of the jar and his stool
	is toppling over.
and I don't think she realizes he's falling over, she's reaching for a
	cookie.
and here the water in the sink is making a puddle on the floor.
and the woman is going to step in it or is stepping in it.
and what's wrong did you say hm.
everything that's happening.
and she's trying to dry dishes and she's got the curtain mixed up with the
	dish that she's drying I think.
and I don't have my glasses on.
oh the water's running out_of the sink.
and there's something happening in the yard.
I can't see it but.
okay.
that's good.
