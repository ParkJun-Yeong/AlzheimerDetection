and there's the picture.
okay.
the mother is washing dishes.
and the water is flowing from the sink.
she's looking out the window.
the son or the boy's on a stool which he's about to fall off stealing
	cookies from the cookie jar and giving it to probably his little sister.
there are two cups and a dish on the sink counter.
and the lady at the sink has a dish and a dry cloth.
do you want me to describe her clothes.
no.
oh.
okay that's it.
thank you.
