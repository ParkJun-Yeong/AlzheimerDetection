look at that picture and tell me what you see going on.
an average home that looks very much like ours at many times.
well she's spilling her water which is not very good but she's washing
	dishes and drying them.
and one of the children upset the cookie jar.
and that's a very average thing to go on in a home.
our home it's a very active family.
and so that it makes it kind_of hard at our house sometime because there's
	like I said a_lot_of activity.
okay you see anything else going on over here.
well the poor girl is spilling the water on her feet.
it's gonna be wet but then she'll hafta struggle with that.
also there are a few more dishes left that didn't get finished.
this hasta be the dishes.
and how that little boy fell off that stool I don't know but he did.
anything else.
no.
okay.
