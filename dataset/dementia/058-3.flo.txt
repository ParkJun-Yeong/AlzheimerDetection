well the little boy is stealing cookies and giving it to his friend or
	sister.
he's partially gonna fall off the stool.
his sister is telling him to be quiet.
the mother is washing dishes.
and the water is overflowing onto the floor and she's standing in a puddle
	and has a smile on her face.
okay.
