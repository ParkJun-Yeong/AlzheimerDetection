I'm gonna show you a picture.
and in the picture there's some action taking place, there's some things
	going on.
what I want you to do is just look at the picture and tell me anything at
	all that you see going on.
a boy's falling off the stool, picking up cookies.
the girl's reaching up for it.
the lady is drying dishes.
the water is running over from the sink into the floor.
the window's opened.
dishes on the counter.
okay.
she's outside.
okay good.
