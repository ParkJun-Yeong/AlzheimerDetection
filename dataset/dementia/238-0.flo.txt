I want you to tell me anything that you see going on in that picture.
mhm.
what do you see.
the cookie jar.
with the girl helping him.
but that isn't the right thing.
but their mother was there spilling water.
this wouldn't be the grandmother I guess.
it's the children.
okay what do you see going on over here.
well I think he's going to fall pretty quick.
but she was helping.
he handed the cookies to his sister I guess.
mhm.
anything else.
well it.
the mother was drying her dishes.
she better get the water off.
anything else.
well he might fall soon if he doesn't.
but he's careful.
is that it.
I think so.
okay.
