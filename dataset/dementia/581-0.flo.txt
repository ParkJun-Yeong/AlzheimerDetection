what's going on in the picture.
well the water is running out over the sink and over this.
the little boy is going up into the cookie jar but he's on the top of the
	stool that he's gonna fall off since it's tipping over.
the water that's also on the floor that's coming out_of the sink.
and let's see here.
okay.
no I don't think I see the water in here and that.
yeah it goes all the way down into this kitchen floor.
okay.
here he is the boy who's taking the cookie out_of the cookie jar but steps
	back on the stool to get to the top of the drawer.
that's about all.
okay that's fine.
