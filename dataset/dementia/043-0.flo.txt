there's the picture.
there's a little girl.
and a little boy standing on top of a stool.
and it looks like a mother maybe washing the dishes in the kitchen.
there's cookies in the jar up in the pantry I suppose.
there's two cups and a saucer or a plate maybe.
there's some shrubs outside.
the sink is overflowing right now.
and that's about all.
okay.
the sink is overflowing.
mhm.
the sink is overflowing.
what's happening over there.
he's trying to kill himself.
you want more.
nope I'm just.
that's it.
that's it, that's fine.
