name me any action.
anything you see in the picture.
alright.
okay.
action.
oh well the little girl is reaching waiting for her brother to give her a
	cookie.
the boy has a cookie from a cookie jar but he's knocked the lid off and he
	is tumbling off a stool.
and mother is drying dishes but she has left the spigot on and water's
	pouring out of the sink.
and the little girl has her finger up to her mouth.
and a boy has one cookie in his hand for the girl in his left hand and he
	is just touching another cookie with his right hand.
you only want action you say.
mhm.
and that's about it.
okay.
