okay now here's the picture.
you tell me all of the actions.
actions going on.
right.
this one's a little boy falling off a stool.
little girl's holding her hand up telling him one time.
this girl's washing the dishes.
I don't seem to know where she got the dish.
I just picked it up.
said she.
oh she's broken a dish back there.
this thing fell down off of there.
something else.
well I_mean the water is running.
it's running over on the floor.
she's got a couple plates waiting here for her.
and the window shows the scene outside that you can't see from here at all.
mhm.
okay.
and there's a little boy and a little girl here just a little.
okay.
that's fine, thank you.
