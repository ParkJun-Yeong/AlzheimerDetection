picture.
oh.
huh.
which moves.
just tell me everything you see going on in the picture.
oh.
the boy is taking cookies out_of a cookie jar.
his mama's washing the dishes.
and the water is coming over the sink into the floor.
and she's wiping the dishes.
and as I'd said the boy is falling.
and the girl's got her hand up to get the cookie.
and what else do you wanna know.
that's all.
did I get it right.
okay that.
