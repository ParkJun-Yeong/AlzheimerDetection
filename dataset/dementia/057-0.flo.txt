okay.
I see a boy on a stool.
and the stool is falling over while he is reaching for the cookie jar.
and his sister is reaching.
he has two cookies in his left hand.
and his sister is reaching hoping to get the cookies in his hand.
and the mother is drying the dishes while the water's filling up and
	overflowing onto the kitchen floor.
and the window's open.

I can't see anything else going on.
the curtains are blowing.
I can't see anything else.
