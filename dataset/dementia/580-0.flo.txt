nope.
I want you to look at this picture.
take a look at that picture and tell me everything you see going on there.
cookie jar.
tell me everything that's happening in that picture.
well the little boy went up on the little stool and he's half way coming
	down though he's gonna fall down.
and the little girl, they're trying to reach up that cookie jar.
you_know he's the one that's trying to get the cookie jar.
and the next thing I guess eventually he'll fall down because he's on two
	legs only out on the darn thing here you_know.
and the mother or whatever she is , she's doing the dishes.
she's already cleaning the dishes.
see, and she's got everything on her own side.
so now what else shall I do.
that's all.
that's good.
very good.
