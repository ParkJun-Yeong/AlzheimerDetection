I see a little boy climbed up on a stool that is reaching for a cookie
	out_of the cookie jar.
the stool is about to fall.
his sister is telling him to be very quiet.
and also at the same time she is reaching for the cookie that he has in his
	hand.
the mother is apparently washing or drying the dishes.
and she has neglected to shut the water off and the sink is overflowing.
I think that's all I see going on.
okay.
