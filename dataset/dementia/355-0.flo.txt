picture okay.
now wait a minute.
everything that's going on in the picture just by looking at it.
mhm.
well, she's wiping dishes.
and the boy is getting cookies out_of a jar.
and he's on a stool.
and there's cups over here.
and the water's going on the floor.
and the housewife, the mother, is wiping the dishes.
and she's standing by the window.
and she's letting the water run out_of the faucet onto the floor.
and the ladder is falling over when he's getting the cookies out.
what else you want.
that's good.
