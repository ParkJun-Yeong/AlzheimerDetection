I'd like for you to take a look at this picture.
mhm.
I'd like for you to tell me everything that you see happening in there.
everything that's going on in that picture.
well let's see.
it looks like a woman.
I assume she's drying a dish.
there's a window open in the kitchen.
it is a kitchen.
there is a child reaching for a cookie from the cookie jar.
the stool that he's standing on is beginning to fall.
there's a little girl in the house.
looks like mother has something fixed for dinner I guess it is on the sink.
either that or the dishes she's dried, I'm not sure.
there's water running over the sink.
I guess that's about it.
