I'd like for you to take a look at this picture.
and I want you to tell me everything that's happening in this picture.
everything that you see going on there.
the water's spilling over the sink.
and stool's tipping when the boy's trying to get a cookie.
mother's drying the dishes.
the girl's asking for another cookie.
you can see outside into the garden.
do you want more.
no if you're done then.
mhm.
okay good.
