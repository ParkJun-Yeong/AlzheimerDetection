look at this picture here.
I'd like you to look at this picture and tell me everything that you see
	happening in the picture.
everything that you see going on.
well a little boy is stealing cookies out_of the cookie jar and giving some
	to his sister.
and his stool is starting to fall so he's gonna fall.
mhm.
and the lady's drying the dishes.
and her sink's running over.
suspect it's running and she didn't turn it off and it's running over on
	the floor.
she's drying dishes and watching out the window at the same time.
okay.
