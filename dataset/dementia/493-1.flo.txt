I'd like for you to take a look at that picture.
I want you to tell me everything that's going on in that picture.
everything that's happening in that picture.
well I know she's got a wreath or something there to put up maybe on a
	window.
I don't know.
and there's two dishes.
and I don't know what that is.
it could be to throw them things around.
I don't know.
and over here is your spigot as was your water.
it must have run over.
I don't know.
and there's a cookie jar.
the little boy's the getting a cookie jar.
one for his sister.
and he's almost upset here.
so I don't know what to tell you.
she's got a short apron on and a dress underneath it I think.
the water's flowing over.
there's two cups.
and that must be one of those they throw around.
okay thanks.
