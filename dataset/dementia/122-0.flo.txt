well, why what is she.
she's interested in something else and she doesn't realize that her water
	is spilling.
and the children having a good time because while their mother's interested
	in something else they're stealing cookies.
the boy looks like he's gonna be hurt.
and oh the water's overflowing.
I hope I didn't go too fast.
it's okay.
I've got the tape recorder on so.
what's happening there.
the boy is falling.
and oh he's stealing cookies too.
mhm.
okay.
