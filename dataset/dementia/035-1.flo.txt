now there it is.
alright.
the little girl wants cookie.
the boy is getting her one but he's going to fall off the stool.
it's tilting.
the mother is doing the dishes.
and unfortunately the sink is overflowing on the floor.
it's wet.
the little.
oh that's his feet.
I thought there was something around the little boy's foot or at least just
	one foot on top of the other.
the little girl I don't whether she's laughing or asking for the cookie or
	saying shh so mother doesn't hear them.
okay.
