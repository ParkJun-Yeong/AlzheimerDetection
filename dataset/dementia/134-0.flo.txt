there it is.
well there's a boy trying to get some cookies from the cupboard.
and then the little girl has her hand up for one.
and there's a stool that's ready to fall that he's standing on.
and there's a lady washing dishes and her sink is filled up full of water
	and it spilled all on the floor.
she's standing by the window.
see the grass and the shrubbery outside.
and two cups and a plate to be that's laying on the sink.
I don't know if it's to be dried or what.
okay thank you.
