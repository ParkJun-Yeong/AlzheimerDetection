okay here's the picture.
a girl is putting her finger up to her mouth and her arm up towards the
	boy.
the boy is on a stool and the ladder is about to go down.
and he has a cookie in his left hand.
and he has his right hand is in the cookie jar.
the lid of the cookie jar is off the jar.
and the cupboard door is open.
but that's not an action is it.
there's a girl standing in front of the sink and drying a plate.
and the water is running in the sink and onto the floor.
and I can't tell if it's raining outside or not.
guess I wouldn't get it outside the window.
okay.
okay great.
