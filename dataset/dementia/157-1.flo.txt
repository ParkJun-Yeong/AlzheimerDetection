okay.
alright.
what do you see going on in this picture.
this picture.
uhhuh, what's the action.
well, there's a kid on a stool.
it's a boy, and a girl on the floor.
and the boy is changing the time.
he has his right hand up at the clock but his left hand is holding where
	he's gonna turn the time.
he's standing on his right foot.
his left leg is bent at the knee, and so he has both feet on the stool but
	it isn't gonna be for long.
the stool is falling down.
and little girl is telling him what ails him.
but she can hardly keep from laughing.
at the same time here she's standing there on both feet, planted solidly on
	the ground, on the floor.
and she's got her finger up to her mouth.
she's trying to keep from laughing at him.
anything else.
well the little boy's on the stool and the stool's just about ready to fall
	down.
and he has one hand up on the clock and the other hand he has a watch or
	something in his hand he is gonna show.
the little girl is standing there.
she got a little short skirt on and the short sleeved dress.
and in one she's pointing to her face with her right hand, with her left
	hand she's gesturing.
okay.
what do you see going on in this side of the picture.
oh on this side of the picture.
well this is a fountain that has found a leak.
and it's going every which way up there.
and , I don't know.
I don't know what you'd call that, this little thing on the mantle there.
and the fountain is squirting up into the air and turned on.
and beside it there's also a little cross that indicates the thing.
and on this side it's.
well she got the left hand on this side the right hand on this side.
and she's looking this way.
and she's standing on her right foot mostly.
her other foot is to keep the balance.
and she's in the corner of the room.
and behind her is a little trap door for I suppose into some cupboard or
	something.
okay.
