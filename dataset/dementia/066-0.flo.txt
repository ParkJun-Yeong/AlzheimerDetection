what do you see going on.
well the boy's on the stool.
and the stool's tipped over.
and it's not a ladder it's a step+stool.
and she's.
from what I can see he's going to upset the cookies.
and the sink is flowing over on the floor while the mother I guess is
	drying the dishes.
boy I'll tell you I wouldn't wanna be on that step+stool there.
it's not even a step+stool.
it's just a stool.
anything else going on.
the water's overflowing on the floor.
okay.
there's probably some more water back this way but I'm not too sure at all
	except that the water's pouring down.
uhhuh.
do you see anything else.
I'm trying to figure out what this is out here.
okay well that's fine.
