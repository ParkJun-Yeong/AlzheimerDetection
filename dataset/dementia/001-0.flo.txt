this is the picture.
mhm.
just tell me everything that you see happening in that picture.
alright.
there's a young boy that's getting a cookie jar.
and he's in bad shape because the thing is falling over.
and in the picture the mother is washing dishes and doesn't see it.
and so the water is overflowing in the sink.
and the dishes might fall over there if you don't get it.
and it's a picture of a kitchen window.
and the curtains are very distinct.
but the water is still flowing.
okay thank you very much.
