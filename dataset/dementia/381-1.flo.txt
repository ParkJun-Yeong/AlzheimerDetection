tell me what you see going on in the picture.
well the boy is in the cookie jar.
and his sister is trying to take it from him.
and he's on a stool going like this.
and then there's a female over here with a plate in her hand that she's
	drying dishes.
the water went overboard on this one on this sink.
it's on the floor.
and the boy's getting cookies and his stool is wobbling.
okay.
okay.
right here see.
okay, good, thank you.
