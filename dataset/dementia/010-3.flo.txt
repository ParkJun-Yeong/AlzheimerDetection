the girl's laughing at her brother because he went into the cookie jar and
	he's falling over the cookie jar.
and the mother was at the sink.
and the water's splashing over the sink.
and she sort_of a little bit bitchy.
and the water's going flooding over the sink.
and there's a saucer, there's a plate, there's a couple of dishes.
well and the mother's looking out the window.
she don't know what the hell to think of it.
a girl laughing at her brother who is taking cookies out_of the cookie jar
	and he's ready to fall off the stool he's on.
the stool's crooked.
what the hell else.
and then there's a plate, saucer and two cups.
she's looking out the window.
the window's open.
she's not paying any attention to the kids.
the water's flooding over the sink.
what else you want.
that's fine.
