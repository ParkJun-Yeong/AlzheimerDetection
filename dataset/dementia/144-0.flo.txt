okay here's the picture.
tell me all of the action that you see going on.
well first of all the cookie jar is coming down it looks like but the
	little boy's climbing up the stool.
he's falling down.
and he's gonna pass some cookies on to his sister but I don't know if he'll
	make it there with them.
and over here the mother spilled, let the water run over which I have done
	lots of times.
and she's gonna hafta get a towel and mop it up very quickly.
that's about all on that one.
that's similar.
I_mean very small.
I don't know what these little gadgets are but I guess they had little.
oh that's part of the little cover.
part of the little cover yeah.
is that all on that one.
okay.
I don't see anything else.
okay.
her feet may be getting wet in on the floor too but outside of that that
	was the worst.
okay good thank you.
