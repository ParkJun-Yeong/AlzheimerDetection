I'd like for you to take a look at this picture.
take a look at that picture and tell me everything that you see happening
	in that picture.
everything's that going on there.
the boy's in the cookie jar but the stool is lopsided.
he couldn't be standing like that.
on a stool on two legs.
and the mother's letting the water run over the sink.
well I assume she's already washed the plate that she's drying.
I don't know what else she is.
whether that would be mistake or not.
that's about all I can see there.
okay that's fine.
