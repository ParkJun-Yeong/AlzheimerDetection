here's the picture.
oh boy.
wowie the boy's going up on a stool to get cookies and he's falling off the
	stool and his sister is just wondering about it.
will he hit the bottom.
mama has a sink that's overrunning with water splashing down onto her
	shoes.
she's in the process of drying dishes.
she's looking out an open window at the same time.
the cookie jar is open.
and the girl has her finger to her lips.
well let me see.
everything that's going to happen, huh.
mhm.
looking out the window I don't know if it's the breeze blowing the curtains
	because over the window they look a little wee bit puffy.
so maybe there's a slight breeze coming in the kitchen window.
mama's drying the dishes and she forgetting herself and the water is
	overflowing from the sink down onto the floor splashing into her shoes.
alright there are two cups and a plate on the counter to the right of the
	sink.
and well I did tell you the boy is getting ready to fall off of the stool.
his sister is reaching up for a cookie, getting it from the cookie jar.
so what else.
the door is open of_course to get into the cupboard.
doing.
three legged stool.
and that's about it.
I would venture to say that is it.
okay.
