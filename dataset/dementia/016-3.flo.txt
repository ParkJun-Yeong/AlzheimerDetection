I'm going to ask you to do this.
just look at the picture and tell me anything you see going on.
a boy is reaching for the cookie jar and tipping over on the stool.
and the girl is starting to laugh.
oh a mother's drying dishes.
the water's spilling out of the sink.
I don't see anything going on outside but.
okay.
