tell me everything that you see going on in that picture.
well the lady's drying her dishes.
the little boy's up on a ladder reaching for cookie jar.
and the little girl's down on the floor reaching up toward him.
then I see a sink, the dishes, cupboard.
and then there's a walkway in the back.
I guess that's a walkway I call.
anything else.
what else is going on in that picture.
the water's running over the sink.
okay.
anything else.
well I said the little boy's climbing up for the cookies.
