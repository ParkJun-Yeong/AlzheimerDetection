well the kid is it falling off the stool.
and he's.
and the mother's drying dishes.
and the sink is spilling over.
and what else.
and the floor's getting wet.
what else is new.
anything else going on in the picture.
and the kid.
well the kid is stealing the cookies.
and he's falling off the stool.
what else.
there isn't much else left.
okay.
that's fine.
