the door's open in the cupboard.
and there's a cookie jar and a little boy on a stool.
and he's trying to reach the cookies.
and the stool is going to go.
and his sister's trying to help him.
and his mother is looking out the window.
and she's letting her water run down the sink.
and.
and the boy is going to be hurt.
okay.
