anything going on in the picture.
alright let's start over here.
the little boy is standing on a stool which is about to fall over.
and he is getting a cookie out_of the cookie jar.
and his little sister comes.
the lid's off.
and he has a cookie in his hand.
and his little sister is down here.
and she has her hand up to take the a cookie out_of the little boy's hand.
he's giving it to her.
and her mother is standing at the sink wiping a dish with a tea towel.
and then there's a sink that has faucets.
and the water is on.
and she's is spilling over onto the floor.
and on the sink also there are two cups and a plate.
and above the sink is a window.
and you look out and you see the garage and a drive into which has bushes
	on the side.
and in the garage there's also a window.
and then up the curtains.
and you can see the top of the garage out the window.
and her curtains curtains on her window.
and the cupboards are underneath the sink.
and it's a good job there if you ask.
okay good.
