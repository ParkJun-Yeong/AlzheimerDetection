what do you see going on in the picture.
well the mother is drying the plate.
and the water is running on the floor overrunning in the sink.
the kids are taking cookies from the cookie jar.
and on a high stool you_know to reach up to the cupboards.
and the girl is receiving the cookies.
the sister I suppose.
the little girl.
the little boy is taking the cookies and he's handing them to her.
and I'd be there eating them too because I like cookies.
my hand is always in the cookie jar.
and the mother is drying the dishes.
at the sink.
the water's running over.
okay.
and she's not paying any never minds to it I guess.
the floor's getting wet.
she'll hafta get a mop and mop it up.
she doesn't care, yeah.
oh this is crazy.
how_about over here.
is anything else going on over here.
well the kid's going to fall from the high stool.
that's dumping over and he's going to land on his rear end pretty soon.
those might be a couple cookies in his hand.
probably the cookie jar spilled too.
he might catch that when it went to the floor.
yeah.
okay.
that's about all.
okay.
the sink is running over.
the water's dripping on the floor, all over the floor.
the old lady will hafta get a mop and mop up the floor too after she's
	through with washing the dishes.
