every action you see going on in the picture.
can you tell me what's going on in the picture.
tell me all of the action.
well he's stealing a cookie.
and the stool's tipping.
and the sink's running over.
what else is going on.
she's standing in water for one thing.
and there's a path out there in the yard.
may be a cookie jar and him getting a cookie and the stool upsetting.
a sink running over.
she's standing in the water in the path.
that looks like the roof of the house here.
I guess that's all.
okay good.
