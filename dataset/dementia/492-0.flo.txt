what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna show you a picture.
now in the picture there are some things going on, there's some action
	taking place.
what I want you to do is look at the picture and tell me anything at all
	that you see going on.
can you tell me anything that you see going on in the picture.
oh yes quite a_lot.
okay go ahead.
the kid's trying to get the cookie jar down and he's gonna fall down off
	the ladder or the stool whatever it is.
and she's trying to get it out_of his hand.
and she's got little socks on.
and the mother is drying the dishes and the water's slopping all over the
	floor.
and there is a garden outside it looks like.
and there's drapes whatever you call them that's over the window.
and there's dishes over here.
and this looks like cabinets where the water is flowing over.
and somebody's gonna fall down off that stool or whatever it is.
and the little girl has little shoes and socks on.
okay good.
