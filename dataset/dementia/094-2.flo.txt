see going on in the picture.
what do I tell you when I see it.
just tell me what you see.
as I see it.
mhm.
is there something going on there or.
oh that's just.
right I'm just recording it so that I can remember what you said later on.
can you tell me everything that you see going on in that picture.
well the first bad thing I see is the water running out of the sink running
	over.
and the little boy up stealing cookies and giving one to his sister.
and mom is drying the dishes and standing in the water.
she's looking the other direction.
and the little boy's falling off the stool definitely standing up on to get
	the cookie.
he's gonna get hurt when he hits that sink.
sounds like an airplane going crazy.
yeah.
okay.
is there anything else that you needta say.
no.
you can see out the window out into the yard.
and you can see a window over there on the other side of the house.
okay that's fine.
