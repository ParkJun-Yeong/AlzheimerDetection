I want you to take a look at that picture.
ah oh boy.
I want you to tell me everything you see happening there.
mhm.
everything that's going on in that picture.
oh the kids are trying to get the cookies.
and she's laughing but holding her hand up to him.
and they know he's gonna fall off the stool.
and their mother's doing the dishes and not being careful.
she didn't turn the water off and the water's all going to the floor
	instead of getting the dishes all dry.
that's all I can.
okay.
and two cups and a plate.
great.
that's it.
thanks.
