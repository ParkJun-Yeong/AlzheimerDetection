the picture.
what.
tell me what you see going on in the picture.
the boy's handing some cookies to the little girl.
and the stool is tipping over.
and the water's overrunning onto the floor.
do you see anything else.
anything else going on in the picture that you wanna mention.
is there anything else you wanna mention.
she's standing in a puddle of water.
okay.
I guess that's about all.
okay.
