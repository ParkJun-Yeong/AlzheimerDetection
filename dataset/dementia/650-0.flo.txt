a boy is putting something in the closet.
or he could be taking a cookie jar out.
and he's the step+stool is tilting.
and a young girl seems to whisper to him about making noise.
did you notice that.
mhm.
yeah.
now do I go over on the other side.
mhm the whole picture.
whole picture.
there's a older woman well young still.
I mean to say that.
then the child over there.
and she's drying dishes or washing them , washing and drying them.
and it looks as if she's spilling water on the floor from the sink.
is there a woman's face at the window.
doesn't it look like there's a face there.
oh no hunhunh.
ain't that.
oh I thought it looked like a nose and a mouth and eye there.
okay.
