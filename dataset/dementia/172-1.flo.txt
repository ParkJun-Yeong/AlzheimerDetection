the picture.
oh the water is running out_of the sink.
mother is calmly drying a dish.
the stool is going to fall over and the little boy is on top of it getting
	in the cookie jar.
and the little girl is reaching for a cookie.
anything else.
she has her finger to her lip as if she's telling the boy not to tell.
the curtains seem to be waving a bit.
the water's running.
and it's splashing on the floor.
is that it.
that's it.
