okay a child falling off a stool in the attempt to reach the cookie jar
	which it looks like he's knocked the lid off.
and maybe he's gonna drop the cookie.
and his girl+friend is standing there beckoning him or reaching for the
	cookie that he's sposta give her.
and the mother is not paying any attention to the kids.
she's looking out the window and drying the dishes.
at the same time she has let the sink run over and the water is cascading
	down on the floor and onto her feet.
the curtains are waving and the window is open.
and the yard looks like it's manicured.
and other than the stool and the cabinets and the dishes that's all I can
	see.
