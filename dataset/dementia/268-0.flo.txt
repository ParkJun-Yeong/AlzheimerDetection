just tell me what's happening in the picture.
the poor mom's getting her feet wet because she thinking of days gone by
	and then the water run.
and that boy whether he knows or not he's gonna crack his head on the back
	of that counter trying to get too many cookies out.
I don't know the significance of that little girl putting her hand to her
	mouth reaching.
unless that's the way all silly girls act at that age.
anything else.
pardon.
anything else.
oh sure.
there's no handles on the cabinet drawers under the counter on the left
	side.
and over in the window you see through the kitchen window all the styles
	are not in the glass.
and if the kitchen window's the same type of window as well the other part
	of the house the style's only in the upper and the laterals.
maybe they build them that way.
no, but I did notice that's a_little I wouldn't say unusual but.
okay anything else that's actually happening.
pardon.
anything else that's going on in the picture.
I said that the sink was overflowing.
that's right mhm okay.
the mother's getting her feet wet.
the boy's going to fall very hard and hurt himself.
and nobody's gonna help him.
well happening.
did I say the cabinet doors where the kids are have no handles on them.
yeah mhm.
oh there's got to be a dozen other things.
it's just what's going on.
responsible.
just what's going on.
well I'll tell you the way mom is looking there's not much going on in her
	head.
she's thinking of dad.
okay.
and the little girl is saying.
sh don't tell mom.
the conflict's in what she's thinking whereas she didn't know the kids are
	behind her.
and did I say.
the cabinet doors are different sizes.
have no handles.
I guess you take a big sledge hammer to that.
okay.
