I want you to tell me all of the action that's going on in that picture.
first of all the little girl's saying.
shh.
and he's climbing up to get a cookie.
and he's going to fall.
and the stool is tipping.
the water is running over in the sink.
the towel seems to go in one side and out the other side of the dish.
oh that's part of the curtain I guess.
that's what it is.
that's part of the curtain.
it looked like it gone through here and come out here.
ah.
two cups and a dish.
anything else.
I don't see anything unusual.
okay that's fine.
