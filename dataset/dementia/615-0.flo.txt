me everything you see happening in that picture.
everything that's going on in that picture.
I see a boy stretching out for a ball or a cake.
he was standing on a stool.
his little sister was reaching out her hand.
and the stool was beginning to go over.
mother was at the dishwasher.
and she left the faucet.
