okay.
well the boy is getting some cookies handing one to his sister.
his sister is shushing so that the mother won't turn around and see.
the stool is going to tip over.
it won't be very quiet.
and the mother is washing the dishes as the sink is running over and
	spilling on the floor.
and she's stepping in the moisture.
any more action.
outside there's nothing special going on in the way of action.
and that's all the action I see.
okay that's fine.
mhm okay.
