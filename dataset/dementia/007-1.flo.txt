can I look at it and tell you.
just tell me as you see it there mhm.
oh okay.
well there's a girl and a boy and the boy's in the cookie jar.
and he's standing on a stool that's tipping over.
and he's in the kitchen.
and the mother's in the kitchen running the water at the sink.
and the water's running over and it's all over the floor.
and there are curtains at the windows.
and there are cups and a plate on the pantry.
and outside the window there's a path leading to a garage it looks like.
and there are curtains there.
and that's about all there.
