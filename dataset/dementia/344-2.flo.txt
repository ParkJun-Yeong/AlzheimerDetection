tell me everything you see happening in that picture.
everything that's going on.
well everything's going wrong.
well tell me what's going on.
tell me everything you see happening.
well the boy who's stealing a cookie for his sister or whoever she is is
	falling backwards.
and the next thing the cookie jar will come down on the floor.
the mother is drying the dishes while the sink runs over and onto her feet.
and she seems to be unaware of what's going on around her.
and the sister is asking for maybe one cookie or another cookie I don't
	know which from her brother.
the mother is working in front of an open window.
and I can't make out what it is.
it looks like a flower bed.
just tell me what's happening.
that's all.
oh.
she's drying the dishes.
mhm.
washing the dishes.
and the others stealing the cookies.
mhm.
and the stool is falling over.
okay.
okay, great.
thank you.
