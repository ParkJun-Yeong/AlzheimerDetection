okey_dokey.
tell me just what you see going on.
well the little boy's in the cookie jar.
and he's about to fall on the floor because the stool's tilted.
mom's drying dishes.
she's not paying attention because the sink's running over.
water's all over the floor.
the little girl I think is begging her brother to give her a cookie.
I'm not sure about that.
must be summer time because the window's open.
you can see the grass and shrubbery outside.
and see a few dishes that mom has already dried.
