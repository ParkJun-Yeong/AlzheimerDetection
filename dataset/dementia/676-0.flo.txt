everything that you see happening in that picture, everything that's going
	on there.
the boy and the girl are playing and he's gonna fall down off the ladder.
and the mother's washing the dishes and it's flying out over the sink down
	to the floor.
what else do you want me to tell you.
that's all.
whatever you see happening.
is that it.
yeah that's it.
okay fine.
