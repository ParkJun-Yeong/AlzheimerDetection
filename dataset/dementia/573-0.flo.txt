I want you to tell me everything that you see happening in there.
everything that you see going on in that picture.
alright.
the young man is trying to get cookies from the cookie jar.
and she's standing laughing at him and he's falling over.
and mama had an accident at the kitchen sink.
either she's daydreaming or something wiping a dish.
and that is overflowing the sink onto the floor and onto her feet.
and the window is open.
and there are two cups and a dish on the counter.
what else do you want me to tell you.
I_mean what did you want me to say.
just anything that's happening.
what was it again.
anything that's happening.
mhm.
oh.
well the window is open.
I guess there's a breeze blowing but that's about all I can see actually
	happening.
okay.
very good.
that's it.
