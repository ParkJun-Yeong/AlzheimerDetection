see going on.
seeing the mother.
she's washing dishes and the water's running all over the floor.
and the boy he's reaching up for cookies.
and his stool slipped from underneath him.
and I guess he's gonna have an accident.
and the little girl she's waiting for the cookies, but I don't think she's
	gonna to get them because the boy's falling down.
okay.
